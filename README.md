# Credit Default Risk Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Credit Default Risk Prediction System is a supervised machine learning project designed to predict the probability of loan default using customer financial and behavioral data.  
The system helps lending institutions improve risk management, reduce default rates, and make data-driven credit approval decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Loan defaults pose significant financial risk to lending companies. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to capture complex customer behavior patterns.  
This project aims to build a machine learning–based solution that accurately identifies high-risk loan applicants before loan approval.

## 📊 Dataset
- Records: 1,000+ loan applicants  
- Data includes:
  - Demographic information
  - Financial attributes
  - Credit history indicators
- Target variable: **Loan Default (Yes / No)**

*(Dataset sourced from publicly available credit risk datasets and adapted for analysis.)*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Tree-based models  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering and selection  
4. Handling class imbalance  
5. Model training and comparison  
6. Model evaluation and performance analysis  
7. Model deployment using Streamlit

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Identified missing values and outliers  
- Analyzed feature distributions and correlations  
- Studied default vs non-default customer patterns  
- Extracted insights to improve feature quality  

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Created meaningful financial ratios  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Scaled numerical features  
- Addressed class imbalance using appropriate techniques  

---

## 🤖 Model Building
Multiple supervised learning models were trained and evaluated.  
Final model selection was based on **ROC-AUC** and **Precision-Recall trade-offs**, ensuring better identification of high-risk customers.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **ROC-AUC:** > 0.78  
- **Performance Improvement:**  
  - ~22% improvement in default identification compared to baseline models  
- Focused on minimizing false negatives (high-risk customers classified as safe)

---

## 🚀 Deployment
The final trained model was deployed using **Streamlit**, allowing:
- Real-time credit risk scoring  
- Applicant risk segmentation  
- Easy interaction for non-technical users  

---

## 📌 Results & Impact
- Improved accuracy in identifying potential defaulters  
- Enhanced decision-making for lending and risk teams  
- Demonstrated real-world application of machine learning in finance  

---

## 📚 Key Learnings
- Importance of EDA in financial datasets  
- Handling imbalanced classification problems  
- Choosing the right evaluation metrics for business problems  
- End-to-end ML workflow from data to deployment  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Incorporate larger and more diverse datasets  
- Add explainability using SHAP / feature importance  
- Improve deployment scalability  
- Integrate with live databases for automated predictions
